# Event-Management-Database-System
The Event Management database project built using PHP and MySQL is designed to manage events in and around New Brunswick.
Four different users have access to the system, each performing his own unique operations:

a)Event manager
b)Attendee[Participant of the event]
c)Performer[Anyone who like to perform in any of the events]
d)Sponsor[Anyone who would like to sponsor an event]

•	The person who creates an event will be added as “Event manager” of the event.
•	Anyone who wants to create, attend, perform or sponsor an event has to be registered and must login into the system
•	All the others [who have not logged in] should be able to view all event details
•	The event manager for any particular event can edit or delete an event that he has created
•	The same user can be an event manager for an event, sponsor an event, perform in an event, and so on.
•	If there is a particular event for which the capacity is filled and participants cannot be added, then the participants are moved to waitlist.
